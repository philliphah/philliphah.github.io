### my purpose

In a world filled with more methods of information transmission than ever before, I reject the status quo of cultural misunderstandings, anachronistic data silos, and ineffective communication between the public and private sectors. I believe that the hard tools brought about by the Data Revolution and the soft skills of empathy, diversity, and mutual respect are the keys to a more just and resilient society. Now is the perfect storm of cultural, historical, and economic factors to spread this message; I seek to use these tools and my multidisciplinary background to facilitate communication and accelerate the deployment of critical technologies, not only in my field of renewable energy, but for the sake of sustainable development writ large.

### my history

My story is one of constant exposure to different perspectives and adapting to new and ambigous environments. Born and raised in Portland, Oregon, from an early age I was taught the importance of community and stewardship of the environment in which it was formed. Economic instability from the Great Recession forced my parents to move to Atlanta during my Sophomore year of high school. From the age of 16 after spending the rest of the year at the home of one of my best friends, I went to a boarding school in Western Massachusetts, attended college in Washington, DC, and received my Master's in Public Policy from a university in North Carolina. Throughout my life, my greatest joy has been to meet and take in the stories of those most different from myself.
